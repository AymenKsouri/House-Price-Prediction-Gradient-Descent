# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression (Gradient Descent from Scratch)

This project implements a **Multiple Linear Regression** model from scratch — optimized using **Batch Gradient Descent** and **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)** — to predict house prices from the **Ames Housing Dataset**.

The goal is to explore the **mathematical foundations** of supervised regression, apply **data preprocessing and feature engineering**, and understand how gradient descent converges towards an optimal solution.

## 📐 Mathematical Background

### Linear Regression Model:
\[
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2 + \dots + \theta_nx_n
\]

### Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):
\[
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
\]

### Gradient Descent Update Rule:
\[
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}
\]

With **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**:
\[
J_{reg}(\theta) = J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2
\]

## ⚙️ Model Training

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning Rate (α): 0.01  
- Iterations: 2000  
- Regularization (λ): 0.1  
- Optimization: Batch Gradient Descent  

**Diagnostics:**
- Features scaled using `StandardScaler`
- Cost function converges smoothly
- No NaN or Inf values detected  

---

## 📈 Results & Evaluation
- Cost decreased consistently across iterations ✅  
- Mean predicted price close to actual range (~\$180,000–\$200,000)  
- Residuals approximately normally distributed  
- R² and RMSE computed to assess performance  

*(You can add actual numeric values once you rerun and fix the NaN issue.)*
